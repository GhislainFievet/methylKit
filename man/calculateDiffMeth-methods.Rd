}
\arguments{
\item{.Object}{a methylBase or methylBaseDB object to calculate differential methylation}

\item{covariates}{a data.frame containing covariates, which should be included in the test.}

\item{overdispersion}{If set to "none"(default), no overdispersion correction will be attempted.
If set to "MN", basic overdispersion correction will be applied. 
(NOT IMPLEMENTED: If set to "shrinkMN", overdisperison correction with squeezeVar() 
from the limma-package will be applied (not implemented as of yet).}

\item{adjust}{different methods to correct the p-values for multiple testing. 
Default is "SLIM" from methylKit. For "qvalue" please see \code{\link[qvalue]{qvalue}} 
and for all other methods see \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}.}

\item{effect}{method to calculate the mean methylation different between groups 
using read coverage as weights (default). When set to "mean", the generic mean is applied
and when set to "predicted", a logistic model is used instead.}

\item{parShrinkNM}{a list for squeezeVar(). (NOT IMPLEMENTED)}

\item{test}{the statistical test used to determine the methylation differences. 
The Chisq-test is used by default, while the F-test can be chosen 
if overdispersion control ist applied.}

\item{mc.cores}{integer denoting how many cores should be used for parallel
differential methylation calculations (can only be used in
machines with multiple cores).}

\item{slim}{If set to FALSE, \code{adjust} will be set to "BH" (default behaviour of earlier versions)}

\item{weighted.mean}{If set to FALSE, \code{effect} will be set to "mean" (default behaviour of earlier versions)}

\item{chunk.size}{Number of rows to be taken as a chunk for processing the \code{methylBaseDB} objects (default: 1e6)}

\item{save.db}{A Logical to decide whether the resulting object should be saved as flat file database or not, default: explained in Details sections}

\item{...}{optional Arguments used when save.db is TRUE

\code{suffix}
      A character string to append to the name of the output flat file database, 
      only used if save.db is true, default actions: append \dQuote{_filtered} to current filename 
      if database already exists or generate new file with filename \dQuote{sampleID_filtered}
      
\code{dbdir} 
      The directory where flat file database(s) should be stored, defaults
      to getwd(), working directory for newly stored databases
      and to same directory for already existing database}
}
\value{
a methylDiff object containing the differential methylation 
                     statistics and locations
}
\description{
The function calculates differential methylation statistics between two groups 
of samples. The function uses either logistic regression test
or Fisher's Exact test to calculate differential methylation. 
See references for detailed explanation on statistics.
}
\section{Details}{

Covariates can be included in the analysis. The function will then try to separate the 
influence of the covariates from the treatment effect via a linear model.\cr
The Chisq-test is used per default only when no overdispersion correction is applied.
If overdispersion correction is applied, the function automatically switches to the 
F-test. The Chisq-test can be manually chosen in this case as well, but the F-test only 
works with overdispersion correction switched on.

The parameter \code{chunk.size} is only used when working with \code{methylBaseDB} objects, 
as they are read in chunk by chunk to enable processing large-sized objects which are stored as flat file database.
Per default the chunk.size is set to 1M rows, which should work for most systems. If you encounter memory problems or 
have a high amount of memory available feel free to adjust the \code{chunk.size}.

The parameter \code{save.db} is per default TRUE for methylDB objects as \code{methylBaseDB}, 
while being per default FALSE for \code{methylBase}. If you wish to save the result of an 
in-memory-calculation as flat file database or if the size of the database allows the calculation in-memory, 
then you might want to change the value of this parameter.
